    Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Aurelien Roux and I am a Front-end developer from France.
    I create sleek, user-centered digital experiences on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio is organized into four spaces: Office, Gym, Interests, and Projects.
    You can navigate between rooms using the arrow keys.
    On mobile, every blue dialog box is a clickable button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interaction points are marked with a downward-moving arrow. When you reach one, press the <strong>SPACE</strong> key or click the bottom-right button to activate it.
    If a dialog offers choices (indicated by a pointing hand), use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN</strong> arrows to navigate, and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to select.
    To close a dialog, press or tap <strong>ESC</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To view my CV directly, press <strong>O</strong> or click the button in the top-left corner.
    For help, press <strong>H</strong> or click the top-right button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy the experience!
